# Scoring weights for ranking iron condors
# All weights should sum to 1.0 for interpretability
# Higher weights = more important in final score

weights:
  return_on_risk: 0.30           # Weight for ROR (higher ROR = better)
  distance_from_em: 0.30         # Weight for distance outside expected move
  liquidity: 0.20                # Weight for liquidity quality
  iv_edge: 0.20                  # Weight for IV vs RV edge

# Normalization ranges (for min-max scaling)
# These are typical ranges; will be recalculated from actual candidate pool
normalization:
  ror_min: 10.0                  # Typical minimum ROR (%)
  ror_max: 50.0                  # Typical maximum ROR (%)
  distance_min: 0.0              # Minimum distance (% from spot)
  distance_max: 15.0             # Maximum distance (% from spot)
  iv_ratio_min: 1.0              # Minimum IV/RV ratio
  iv_ratio_max: 2.0              # Maximum IV/RV ratio
